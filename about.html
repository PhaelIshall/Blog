		<h1>About me</h1>
	</header>
	<p>Hi there. My name is <strong> Wiem (wiː æm / ウイエム)</strong>.  </p>
	<p>I recently completed my  <strong> Master’s of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence at Tokyo Institute of Technology (東京工業大学） </strong> where I was member of <strong>  Okazaki lab（岡崎研究室) </strong> , a Natural Language Processing lab. Before that, I was also a member of  <strong> Tsuruoka lab  </strong> in  <strong> the University of Tokyo（東京大学) </strong> , as a research student. </p>

<p> I am currently conducting research in  <strong> Explainable AI </strong>  in the context of NLP and Knowledge Graphs Embeddings. I’m also always up to date with research related to Commonsense reasoning, which has a special place in my heart. I have a background of work and internships at startups as an mobile developer, so I am naturally interested in applied Machine Learning as well (and a fan of clean, well-thought-out code). </p>

<p> I obtained my  <strong> bachelor’s of Science in Computer Science from the American University of Beirut </strong> , in Lebanon where I minored in applied mathematics and philosophy. I am originally from a beautiful coastal city in Tunisia, North Africa. </p>

<p> I was lucky to be the recipient of various scholarships and grants that covered my higher education journey, and therefore I am always happy to share my experience and help qualified and motivated people find better opportunities, if I can </p>
