<!-- 		<p> I’m an avid software developer and instructor turned researcher. I received several prestigious scholarships for undergraduate and graduate studies. </p>
		<p> My first paper based on my Master thesis won the AKBC2021 Outstanding Paper Award. I’m interested in <strong> Explainable AI</strong> , <strong> Human-Centered AI</strong> , and <strong> Fact-Checking</strong>. I like working on both research and engineering projects. </p>
