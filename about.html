<h2 id="content">Who am I?</h2>
<p><span class="image right"><img src="https://github.com/PhaelIshall/Blog/blob/main/assets/images/profile.JPG" alt="" /></span>
 
 <p>I recently completed my Master’s of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence at Tokyo Institute of Technology (東京工業大学）where I am member of Okazaki lab（岡崎研究室), a Natural Language Processing lab. Before that, I was also a member of Tsuruoka lab in the University of Tokyo（東京大学), as a research student. </p>

<p> I am currently conducting research in Explainable AI in the context of NLP and Knowledge Graphs Embeddings. I’m also always up to date with research related to Commonsense reasoning, which has a special place in my heart. I have a background of work and internships at startups as an mobile developer, so I am naturally interested in applied Machine Learning as well (and a fan of clean, well-thought-out code). </p>

<p> I obtained my bachelor’s of Science in Computer Science from the American University of Beirut, in Lebanon where I minored in applied mathematics and philosophy. I am originally from a beautiful coastal city in Tunisia, North Africa. </p>

<p> I was lucky to be the recipient of various scholarships and grants that covered my higher education journey, and therefore I am always happy to share my experience and help qualified and motivated people find better opportunities, if I can </p>

<h2>Why <underlined>Gorilla Sun</underlined>?</h2>

<p><span class="image right"><img src="https://gorillasun.de/assets/images/about/kyoto.png	" alt="" /></span>When I created my instagram account, on which I wanted to share my electronic music as well as my guitar playing, I was trying to come up with a quirky name. After making a long list of different names I set it aside and went through it the next day. 'Gorilla Sun' stood out from this list and sounded the best. Partly why I like is also due to how it sounds in japanese: '
ゴリラサン' where 'sun' can sound like the honorific title 'san' which you address colleagues and friends with. Funny, because after all, I am but a sentient monkey.</p>
<p>Later on I this also became my name on spotify and other platforms that I use. So, I guess it kind of is my artist name. And I think you can make an educated guess as to why this blog is called the 'Gorilla Sun Blog'.</p>
<p>Another reason for this alias might be that my name is a little difficult to pronounce for non-arabic speakers, and is also often confused with and pronounced as Ahmed (Ahmad with and e instead of an a), which actually bothers me quite a lot.</p>
<h2>What is this blog about?</h2>
<p>Firstly and mainly this blog is an outlet for me to speak about my interests and where I can share about things that I find cool. The three main categories of things that you can find on this blog will be about: creative coding, making art and music with computers as well as the occasional machine learning blog post for creative applications. I think that the one thing that gives me the most joy in life is creating, making and building things. Be it music, art or software. I enjoy it even more to share my findings and being able to talk about them to others. I also have a big passion for writing, which is a convenient extra.</p>
<hr class="major" />
<h2>Roadmap and Future Plans?</h2>
<p>Goal #1 right now is to make a write for all of the things that I've coded up in the past couple of months, as well as in the past two years. My backlog of things to write about is getting way too long! Secondly, a gallery tab for all of my sketches is in the works, but I have yet to figure out a nice way to display all of them! Lastly, I'm also working on another website that is mainly dedicated towards machine learning and data sience topics, and which I hope to get off it's feet very soon, so keep your eyes peeled for that.</p>

<h2>How to support the Blog?</h2>
<p>Since I just started this website, the best way to support me would probably be to spread the word about it, click and read through some of the things I've written. Doing so actually helps tremendously because you're telling Google (or other search engines) that my content is relevant in some manner. Alternatively you can have a listen to my music on spotify (think of it as tipping me some micro cents), purchase my music on bandcamp (I donate this money for charity) or even just shooting me an email or message on any of my social media accounts.</p>

<p>Recently I've also started putting up NFTs for sale on hicetnunc.xyz, an NFT market place on an eco-friendly blockchain. You can learn more about that on my Twitter.</p>

<h2>Come say hi!</h2>
<p>If you've read this far, <a href='https://twitter.com/gorillasu'>come say hi to me on some of my social media</a>, I'd love to connect, answer any questions you could possibly have or get to know new people, it's partly why I started all of this.
